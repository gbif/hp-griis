GRIIS will be publishing thematic datasets starting November 2025. The first thematic dataset will be a checklist of introduced and invasive pollinators.

The intentional translocation of bee species (e.g. Apis, Bombus) for the puroposes of crop pollination and apiculture has had negative impacts on native pollinators and their networks

Following the IPBES Assessment on Pollinators and Pollination (https://files.ipbes.net/ipbes-web-prod-public-files/downloads/pdf/individual_chapters_pollination_20170305.pdf) Vanbergen et al 2018 published Risks to pollinators and pollination from invasive alien species
